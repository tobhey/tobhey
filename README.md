I am researching in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Software Engineering (SE) with focus on traceability link recovery and requirements engineering.

In my dissertation, I developed the automated traceability link recovery approach [FTLR](https://github.com/tobhey/finegrained-traceability), that is able to relate requirements to their corresponding source code entities by utilizing fine-grained word embedding-based relations. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve developed the requirements classification approach [NoRBERT](https://github.com/tobhey/NoRBERT) and integrated its results as a filter into FTLR.

Previously, Iâ€™ve done research on programming in natural language, mapping natural language instructions to their corresponding API calls.
